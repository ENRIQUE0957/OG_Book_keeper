Bookkeeper
Bookkeeper is a personal finance website I created out of a desire to help individuals who struggle with managing their monthly bills and budgets, especially those who feel overwhelmed or scatterbrained when it comes to keeping track of their finances.
I understand how challenging it can be to juggle multiple expenses, deadlines, and financial priorities. Thatâ€™s why I designed Bookkeeper to provide a simple and intuitive platform for organizing bills, tracking payments, and staying on top of your financial responsibilities.
Features
* Easy input and tracking of monthly bills and expenses.
* Visual tools to monitor due dates and payments.
* Customizable reminders to help avoid missed payments.
* A clean, distraction-free design to reduce overwhelm.
Purpose
My goal with Bookkeeper is to offer a resource for those who feel lost in their financial planning, giving them a straightforward solution to regain control and peace of mind over their monthly budget.
